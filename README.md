# Quote Generator

Welcome to the Quote Generator project! This project is a simple web application that fetches and displays random quotes from an API. It allows users to view a random quote, display it on the screen, and tweet the quote directly from the application.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I have learned and improved my skills in the following areas:

 1. **HTML & CSS**: Structuring a web page and applying styles effectively using HTML and CSS.
 2. **JavaScript**: Enhancing interactivity on the web page by manipulating the DOM, handling events, and working with asynchronous operations using `async` and `await`.
 3. **API Integration**: Fetching data from an external API and handling potential errors gracefully.
 4. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application works well on different screen sizes by using flexible layout techniques.
 5. **Version Control**: Using Git for version control, which helped me manage and track changes throughout the development process.
**Debugging**: Identifying and resolving issues that arose during development, enhancing my problem-solving skills.
